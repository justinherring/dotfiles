# dotfiles

My personal configurations and scripts. Use at your own risk.

I will have a folder for each of the systems I use (e.g., `git-bash`), and all
of the configuration for that system will go in there.

## Installation

I think I'll end up putting all the install scripts in the `bin` folder, so you
can just run `dotfiles/bin/<install-script>` and then everything will be
installed.
