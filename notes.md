# Notes

At some point, I'd like to write my own installation script so I can can keep
all of my files in sync but for now, I'm okay with just having my files
available in the cloud.

I also wanted to use this file as a way to keep track of tools I'd like to have
installed.

## Tools I use

### Windows-specific

* chocolatey
* nvm for Windows
* git for Windows

### General

* jq
